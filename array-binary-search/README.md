# Binary search
Binary search in a sorted 1D array

## Approach & Efficiency
the binarry search method is very effetent in searching for data since each time you iterate you would elemnate like half of the values as posible solutions per loop , not that many variables I think to keep in the nemory

and similarly very effecient timewise for the same reason mentioned previously

## Solution

start the function:
arr= [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
val= 15
low= 0
high= 5 (index of the last element in the array)
index=-1
=======================
while loop :
first iteration :
placement: (0 + 5) / 2 = 2 (since it's an integer)
arr[placement]: 15 (equal the needed value)
assign placement to index
Return index, which is 2
