## Approach & Efficiency
in the first function I used a for loop to populate an emty array of length n and then returned the last element 
in the second method I used recursion 
each method has their advantagesand their disadvantages
in the first function depending on the value of n it can take either no time at all or a very very long time similarly depending on the value of n it could take a very small amout of memory if n value is too small , but if n value is not too small then it could take too long 
on the otherhand  recursion could take smaller time if the value was large enough or could  much longer time when comared to the first method if n is small
